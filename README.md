# A library to control Rotel Sound devices via TCP/IP

Idea and code derived from https://github.com/stormboy/node-pioneer-avr - full credit goes there. I have been using avr pioneer for long time but upgrade to Rotel A14 lately which I wanted to control in a similiar way.

Commands available here: https://www.rotel.com/sites/default/files/product/rs232/A12-A14%20Protocol.pdf

This is very early work - contributors welcome...
